- Add negative test cases (RSA, DSA, ECDSA)
- Make Point::double_scalar_mult() not truly awful
- Use std::Default instead of the bespoke default() in Point?
- Run rustfmt on this stuff
- Run clippy on this stuff
- De-macro. Surely some of this stuff could be turned into trait invocations?
- Test cases for key generation
- Better, timing-resistant ECC point math
- Make the x.509 library not terrible
- Ability to generate a SSH public key line / file
- Extend SSH examples with public key reading/writing
